# HTCCL

Hard Time III Custom Content Loader

Loads custom content for Hard Time III.

## Disclaimer
This is the public beta version of the HTCCL. It's a very early version and may contain bugs. Please report any bugs in the [modding Discord](https://discord.gg/zWzRCTHMdS).

## Getting Started

### Installation
Currently, the only way to install the HTCCL is to install it manually through the GitHub releases. You can find the latest release [here](https://github.com/IngoHHacks/HTCCL/releases/latest). The release bundles BepInEx, so you don't need to install it separately.

1. Download the latest release from the link above.
2. Extract the contents of the zip file to the game's root directory (where the game's .exe is located).
3. Run the game.

### Installing Other Mods
To install other mods, simply extract the mod's contents to `BepInEx/plugins`. If the zip file contains a `plugins` folder, you only need to extract the contents of that folder to `BepInEx/plugins`. It's recommended to have a unique folder for each mod in `BepInEx/plugins` to keep things organized and prevent conflicts or overwrites.

## Documentation
HTCCL is a fork of [WECCL](https://github.com/IngoHHacks/WECCL). Most of the features are the same, but there are some differences. The documentation for WECCL can be found [here](https://ingoh.net/weccl/docs/). Once HTCCL is more stable, it will have its own documentation.

## Support Development
HTCCL is developed in my free time and I don't make any money from it. Any support is greatly appreciated and helps me continue to develop HTCCL and other mods/tools. You can donate on my [Ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/IngoH).  
If you want to support the project in other ways, you can share HTCCL with your friends or on social media, join the modding Discord to help others, report bugs, or contribute to the codebase and documentation.
